The very first post. It took a bit longer than expected to get my website up and running, but finally, it is here. This is indeed a major achievement in the history of mankind and I promise to do my outmost to fill it with as much interesting information as possible to keep my readers interested :D


Over the last year I have been trying to specialize myself within the field of data science and I figured it would be nice to have a website to keep all the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/about/projects/">projects</a> I have been working on at one location. Also, I figured it might be interesting for other people to read about what challenges I have had while working with these projects.


I started reading about <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and it seemed as a pretty sleak solution for handling of a website. Although it claims on the Jekyll website that you will have Jekyll up and running within seconds, it took me a bit longer to get everything up and running the way I wanted it. 


I am not going to go into any details on how this website was built in Jekyll, because I more or less followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj4qGjIQCZdL5nIUaoFHanA">Mr. Thomas Bradley's</a> excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWjCJDeWfDdfVEcLGAfdJn_HXyM4Y7_k-">YouTube tutorial on Jekyll</a>. It covers the sufficient information you need to get started and having it up and running on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.


If you find this interesting, then you should be able to comment this post in the coming future. You can also reach out to me <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/contact/">here</a>.
